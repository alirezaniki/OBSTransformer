Description
--

**OBSTransformer** is a transfer-learned seismic phase picker for Ocean Bottom Seismometer data (OBS) adopted from the EqTransformer model. 
**OBSTransformer** has been trained on an auto-labelled tectonically inclusive OBS dataset comprising ~36k earthquake and 25k noise samples.
**OBSTransformer** is now integrated with the hands-free earthquake location workflow-[LOC-FLOW](https://github.com/Dal-mzhang/LOC-FLOW).
You can download the auto-labelled data and noise samples used for model training via [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sM2JD9QF6obfFtIPTB3wQxtDvEhndPVT/view?usp=sharing). Below
snippet code demonstrates how to deal with the dataset:
```
import h5py as hp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dataset = "OBST_training_data.hdf5"
d = hp.File(dataset, 'r')
for item in d['data']:
  if not item.endswith('EV'): continue 
  dd = d.get(f'data/{item}')
  p_arr = dd.attrs['p_arrival_sample']
  s_arr = dd.attrs['s_arrival_sample']
  print(p_arr, s_arr)
  plt.plot(dd)
  plt.show()
```

Installation
--

OBSTransformer is a variant of EqTransformer optimized for OBS data. Visit the [parent repository](https://github.com/smousavi05/EQTransformer) for detailed installation guidelines.

To start with (anaconda):
--

```
conda create -n obst python=3.7
conda activate obst
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install obspy
pip install EQTransformer
```
You may encounter version conflicts between packages, such as numpy or protobuf. Try to install the suggested versions to eliminate the issue.

Quick Instruction
--
  0. OBST works best on 3-20 Hz band-pass filtered data. Change the filtering band in "EQT_PATH/EQTransformer/core/mseed_predictor.py" and "EQT_PATH/EQTransformer/utils/hdf5_maker.py".
  1. Create a text file including instrument information (see stations.dat)
  2. Build the required station metadata using the provided shell script (build_json.sh; needs two addresses)
  3. Prepare the dataset directory (see dataset/)
  4. Run the detection.py code (python detection.py dataset/)
